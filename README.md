# Hour Logger

All Front end development. A simple SPA that is built with React. Serve as a base to learn new other frameworks.

## Purpose

Creating a simple way to document the hour worked through the week. To replace the excel sheet for documenting the hour worked for the week.

The application is built for specific people at the current workspace. Users will be able to document the time that they worked for the week and ensure that they meet the 40 hours requirement.

There should be a default arrival time (the desired time user wishes to attend work). Then the time to leave would be 8 hours from start.

## Requirements

1. Input the time when user has started to work
2. Input the time when user has left work
3. Visual to show how many hour required of current week
4. Setting a Defaults, lunch, in time, out-time
5. adding PTO button
